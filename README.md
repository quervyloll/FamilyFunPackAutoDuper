How to use the auto duper:

1. If you have FFP installed, remove it and replace with the autodupe mod.
2. Make sure you are using donkeys. Mules/llamas are not guaranteed to work.
3. Put dupe donkeys at both ends of the duping trail.
4. Do <.end 1> command standing at one end of your dupe trail.
5. Do <.chest 1> command looking at a DOUBLE chest where you would like the items to go.
6. Do <.end 2> and <.chest 2> at the other end of the duping trail, following same rules.
6. Make sure you nametag the donkey you will be riding between ends.
7. Do <.ad> near the donkey you're going to be riding to start inflating the economy!
DONKEY YOU RIDE HAS TO BE NAMETAGGED

All commands:
.ad (To start the autoduper)
.filldelay (in ms, id put )
.delay (in seconds)
.end 1/2
.chest 1/2
.checkitems (true or false)
.debug (true or false)

Here's the config I would personally use:
.delay 2
filldelay 90
.checkitems should be true
.kickdelay 0
.debug true
