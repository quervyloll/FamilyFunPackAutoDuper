# Important notes before becoming rich:
1. The donkey you are riding must be nametagged
2. Turn off no slow on all clients otherwise you won't move
3. You cannot be using lambda client when using this version of ffp

How to use the auto duper:

1. If you have FFP installed, remove it and replace with the autodupe mod.
2. Make sure you are using donkeys. Mules/llamas are not guaranteed to work.
3. Put dupe donkeys at both ends of the duping trail.
4. Do <.end 1> command standing at one end of your dupe trail.
5. Do <.chest 1> command looking at a DOUBLE chest where you would like the items to go.
6. Do <.end 2> and <.chest 2> at the other end of the duping trail, following same rules.
6. Make sure you nametag the donkey you will be riding between ends.
7. Do <.ad> near the donkey you're going to be riding to start inflating the economy!

All commands:
.ad (To start the autoduper)
.filldelay (in ms, id put )
.delay (in seconds)
.end 1/2
.chest 1/2
.checkitems (true or false)
.debug (true or false)

Here's the config I would personally use:
.delay 2
.filldelay 90
.checkitems should be true
.kickdelay 0
.debug true
